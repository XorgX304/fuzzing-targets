Some fuzzing targets for testing

These are all outdated versions that have easy to find vulnerabilities.

Recommended for testing fuzzers for features or for performing comparisons.

All targets are for Linux except for ```foxit-pdf-fuzz.zip``` which is for testing winafl and other Windows fuzzers.
